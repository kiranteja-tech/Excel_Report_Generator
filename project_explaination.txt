# Excel Report Generator using Python

## Project Overview

The Excel Report Generator is a desktop-based data analysis application developed using Python. The project automates the process of transforming raw CSV data into a structured and professionally formatted Excel report. It provides statistical summaries, pivot table analysis, and graphical visualizations through an easy-to-use graphical interface.

The application is designed to reduce manual data processing effort and demonstrate practical usage of Python libraries for real-world data engineering and reporting tasks.

## Project Workflow

1. User launches the application.
2. User selects a CSV dataset file.
3. Program reads and processes the data.
4. Numeric columns are analyzed automatically.
5. Statistical summary is generated.
6. Pivot table is created using categorical data.
7. A bar chart visualization is produced.
8. User selects a save location.
9. Excel report is generated with multiple sheets.
10. Report opens automatically after creation.

## Excel Report Structure

The generated Excel file contains:

* **Sheet 1 – Raw Data**

  * Original dataset imported from CSV

* **Sheet 2 – Summary**

  * Statistical metrics for numeric columns

* **Sheet 3 – Pivot Table**

  * Aggregated analysis based on category data

* **Sheet 4 – Bar Chart**

  * Visual representation of pivot results

## Dataset Description

The sample dataset represents real-world electronic product sales data including:

* Order ID
* Date
* Region
* Salesperson
* Product Category
* Units Sold
* Unit Price
* Revenue

The dataset simulates business sales transactions and is suitable for demonstrating reporting and analytics workflows.
