# Excel Report Generator (Python Project)

##  Overview

The **Excel Report Generator** is a Python-based desktop application that converts raw CSV datasets into structured and professionally formatted Excel reports. The application performs automatic data analysis, generates statistical summaries, creates pivot tables, and visualizes insights using charts — all through a simple graphical interface.

This project demonstrates practical data processing, visualization, and report automation using Python.
